WeddingWebsite
==============

A wedding website complete with an RSVP system, with all personal information 
changed, including photos, and with dummy text.

This website requires access to a database. Use 'DB/guestlist.mysql' to create 
the necessary table and then populate it with information for your guestlist 
(name and email addresses).
